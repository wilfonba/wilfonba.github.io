### About me

I am a third year Ph.D. student studying Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology.
My primary research is on the modeling of gas liquid interfaces under high amplitude accelerations, but I also make regular contributions to MFC, an exascale ready multiphase flow code that scales to 10's of thousands of GPUs.
When I'm not busy with school or research I enjoy spending time outdoors camping, hiking, and climbing or indoors playing board games.
